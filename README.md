# Manga Recommender
 
App that recommends manga based on mangas you liked and disliked

## How can you use it?

Open the main folder and locate MangaRecommender.exe, then run it.

### What I learned/improved from doing this project

1. How to apply multiprocessing and threading to make my code more efficient
2. How to create an interactive desktop application using pysimplegui and pyinstaller 
3. How to work with large datasets, data wrangle and implement feature engineering techniques to effectively setup data for analysis
4. How to use scikit-learn, pandas, SQL, and APIs to collect, organize, and manipulate data

### What I can improve on 

1. Still can improve on my knowlege of pandas and numpy datatypes, as I ran into bottlenecks while working with large datasets
2. Better understanding of scikit-learn, and how to better model and utilize features in my analysis

### What I want to add in the future

1. A better looking app that allows your to keep a record of users
2. Expand the recommendation system. Currently, it uses content-based filtering and bases recommendations off of themes the user previously liked/disliked 
3. Possibly some popup animations to indicate when something is loading
